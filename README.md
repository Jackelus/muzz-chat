# Muzz Chat for Web

Tech test for Muzz, tasdked with creating an implementation of Muzz Chat for Web using React and TypeScript.

This project is a minimal setup for a React application using Vite and TypeScript. It features Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a basic set of ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Getting Started

To launch the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd <project-name>`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `yarn dev`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Roadmap

Things I would like to add to this project if I had longer to complete:

- Implement read receipts and ticks for messages
- Debounce text input
- Check messages sorted by date, currently relying on the order of the array
- Persist messages to local storage and/or setup server and database
- Make responsive for mobile
